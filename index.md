## **What is Task Board**

[**Task Board**](https://github.com/tu2-atmanand/Task-Board) is a plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to view and manage all your task in a much more efficient Kanban board format. Easily manage your tasks throughout your vault from a single place. And automate your task management workflow.

## How Does it work

- This plugin scans tasks from all markdown files from your whole vault and show them on a Kanban type board.
- You can also apply [scan filters](./docs/Features/Filters_for_Scanning.md) to exclude certain files or to only scan certain files to look for tasks.
- You can edit the task directly from the **Task Board**, without opening the Markdown file.
- Add task to currently opened files using a pop-up window.

## Motivation and Vision

I always used the [Kanban Plugin](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-kanban) to manage my tasks. And it use to work nice for me with all the amazing features. But as soon as I came across the [CardBoard plugin](obsidian://show-plugin?id=card-board) everything changed. The idea of adding tasks anywhere in your vault and managing them from a single board amazed me. I immediately switched to the CardBoard plugin after I used it for a while. But after using it for few days, i realized there are few important features this plugin is lacking and hence I went to first contribute to the main project, but I wasn't familiar with the elm files, hence decided to start my own plugin.

While development I took inspirations from CardBoard and Kanban plugin as well as many feature ideas from [GitHub project planning KanBan board](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/customizing-views-in-your-project/changing-the-layout-of-a-view#about-the-board-layout). I hope I am able to give the best of all this three plugins into one, and will be improving this further.

## Support

A great deal of effort has gone into bringing this idea to life. While the plugin was originally created for my personal use, I genuinely believed it could help others streamline their task management and project handling.
