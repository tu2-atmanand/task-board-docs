## **What is Task Board**

[**Task Board**](https://github.com/tu2-atmanand/Task-Board) is a plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to view and manage all your task in a much more efficient Kanban board format. Easily manage your tasks throughout your vault from a single place. And automate your task management workflow.

## How Does it work

- This plugin scans tasks from all markdown files across your entire vault and shows them in a Kanban type board.
- [Scan filters](./docs/Features/Filters_for_Scanning.md) can be applied to scan only specific files or to exclude specific files.
- You can edit the task directly from the **Task Board**, without opening the Markdown file.
- Add tasks to currently opened files using a pop-up window.

## Motivation and Vision

Previously, I always used the [Kanban Plugin](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-kanban) to manage my tasks. It had many amazing features and worked nicely for me, but as soon as I came across the [CardBoard plugin](obsidian://show-plugin?id=card-board) everything changed. The idea of being able to manage from one spot tasks from anywhere in my vault amazed me. After experimenting with the CardBoard plugin for a while, I quickly switched. However, after I used it for few days, I realized there were some important features it was lacking. I had some challenges with contributing to their main project, so I instead decided to start my own plugin.

While in development, I took inspiration from the CardBoard and Kanban plugins, as well as many feature ideas from [GitHub project planning KanBan board](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/customizing-views-in-your-project/changing-the-layout-of-a-view#about-the-board-layout). It is my hope that I am able to give the best of all three plugins in one place, as well as take improvements even further.

## Support

A great deal of effort has gone into bringing this idea to life. While the plugin was originally created for my personal use, I genuinely believed it could help others streamline their task management and project handling.
