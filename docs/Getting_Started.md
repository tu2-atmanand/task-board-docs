# Getting Started

## **Step 1:** Opening the Task Board

After proper installation, **Task Board** can be opened by clicking the new icon on the ribbon bar:

*Note: in the gif above, you can also see the manual vault scanning for the next step.*

**Task Board** can also be opened by:
- Using the command `Open Task Board` from the Command Palette.
- Assigning a shortcut for the command from the **Hotkey** tab in Obsidian's general settings.

## **Step 2:** Scan tasks for the first time

Click on the **Scan Vault Modal** button. It is located inside the "View Header" in the top-right corner. This will open a window that can manually scan all of the files in your vault for tasks.

**NOTE:** You won't need to use this "Scan Vault" feature often. It is only for fresh install or for special cases like troubleshooting or solving any other issue. Learn more here: [Scan Vault Feature](./Features/Scan_Vault_Feature.md)

All tasks with the [accepted format](./Components/Task_Formats.md) will be scanned and will be displayed on the board based on the specific [Column Criteria](./Components/Types_Of_Columns.md).

Afterwards, use the [Scanning Filters](./Features/Filters_for_Scanning.md) from the main settings to only scan specific files and ignore other files.

There are already two predefined board for your convenience as an example. Feel free to delete or edit the boards and create your own boards. Check out more information on Board here: [Creating Boards](./How_To/HowToCreateNewBoard.md)

**Enjoy the plugin !**
