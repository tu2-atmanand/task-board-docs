# Mobile Support
{: .d-inline-block }

v1.4.0
{: .label .label-blue }

Task Board now provides comprehensive mobile support, allowing you to manage your tasks on phones and tablets with an optimized user interface and experience.

## Mobile Optimizations

### UI/UX Improvements

- **Responsive Layout**: Task Board automatically adjusts to different screen sizes
- **Touch-Friendly Controls**: All buttons and interactive elements are optimized for touch input
- **Keyboard Management**: The on-screen keyboard is automatically hidden when opening the Add or Edit Task modal (v1.6.11)
- **Auto-hide Progress Bar**: Board progress bar automatically hides on small screens or when the screen is resized (v1.6.11)
- **Board switcher panel**: A new panel has been implemented which can be opened using the hamburger icon on top-right corner, left to the current board name.

### Platform-Specific Features

- **Height Adjustment**: Task Board adjusts its height based on the platform and window dimensions (v1.6.11)
- **Mobile-Optimized Modals**: All pop-up windows and modals are designed to work seamlessly on mobile devices
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Enhanced scrolling performance for task columns on mobile devices

## Mobile Workflow

### Managing Tasks on Mobile

1. **View Tasks**: All your boards and tasks are accessible on mobile devices
2. **Add Tasks**: Use the simplified Add Task modal designed for touch input
3. **Edit Tasks**: Full editing capabilities with mobile-optimized interface
4. **Search Tasks**: Quick search functionality works smoothly on mobile
5. **Task card menu**: As drag and drop functionality is not available for mobile devices and as its also very difficult to use on small screens. Cards has been provided with a menu, which can be opened by long-pressing the card, or by tapping in the top-right corner within the card.

### Best Practices for Mobile

- Use the search feature to quickly find tasks instead of scrolling through long lists
- Take advantage of auto-hiding elements to maximize screen space
- Configure boards with fewer columns for easier mobile navigation
- Use the board switcher in the header to quickly switch between different boards

## Known Considerations

While Task Board works great on mobile, keep these points in mind:

- Some advanced features may have slightly different interactions on mobile
- Larger screens provide more comfortable editing experience for complex tasks
- Sync your vault across devices to seamlessly transition between desktop and mobile

## Mobile Tips

- **Landscape Mode**: For complex boards, try rotating your device to landscape mode for more horizontal space
- **Column Width**: Mobile view automatically adjusts column widths for optimal viewing
- **Task Cards**: Tap on a task card to view details or edit
