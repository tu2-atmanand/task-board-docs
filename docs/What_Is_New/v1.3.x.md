## Task Board v1.3.0 🎉

> YouTube video for this release : https://youtu.be/lTDf0nZmZgM

### New Features 🎁

- **Status for Tasks :** A new property for adding status to your tasks, similar to the one from [Tasks plugin](https://publish.obsidian.md/tasks/Getting+Started/Statuses/About+Statuses).
- **Robustness :** Task Board is not robust enough to work with all your custom task formats. No need to restrict yourself anymore with the pipe symbol (|) functionality to separate your task properties (metadata). Write your tasks the way you want in your notes and Task Board will preserve the format.
- **Confirmation Popup :** After adding any property in the Edit task modal, a confirmation popup will be shown if you accidentally close the modal without saving. #92
- Emojis support for the checkboxes with different statuses. Shout out to [@ITS-Theme](https://github.com/SlRvb/Obsidian--ITS-Theme) for the [Alternate Checkbox CSS Snippet](https://github.com/SlRvb/Obsidian--ITS-Theme/blob/main/Snippets/S%20-%20Checkboxes.css).
- Improved integration with Tasks plugin, to get the same options for setting the task status.
- A new setting option to hide the metadata from task title inside the Task Item card for a clean look.
- A new command to access the "Scan vault window" easily.
