> YouTube video on DFP methodology and map view feature demo : https://youtu.be/mWfbDTO5pyw

The second most requested feature, which may have the potential to use boards as projects, is here, **advanced filters** for boards as well as for columns. This version is loaded with a ton of new features. But mainly its aimed at improving the UI and providing better UI/UX experience, specially for small screens. And the two experimental features from previous versions are now available for normal use after thorough testing.

### New Features 🎁

- **Minimize columns :** Using the column menu option, easily minimize a particular column temporarily. Maximize again by clicking on name. | #386
- **Add or Edit Task window** can now work as modal as well as a tab, so it can be now opened inside a new window to have multiple views opened at the same time. | #382, #67
- A **file filter** has been added inside the search bar to find tasks from a particular file faster. | #334
- Regular Expression support for **Files** and **Folders** in scanning filters. | #154
- **Default start time** setting has been added, if user would like to have a default start time for tasks with universal date. Helpful for sorting. | #420
- A new field to enter **board description**, to see it inside the board cards. | #440
- Refresh button will now going to scan any pending updated notes and then refresh the board.
- A collapsible property section inside the editor of edit task modal has been added. | #386

- Refactoring whole codebase to have organized code structure and cleaning up unnecessary files.
- **Optimization :** Modified notes will be properly tracked until they are finished scanning for tasks to avoid missing of any changes made. | #357
- **Optimization :** If tasks content has not been modified in the edited file, the cache will not be updated unnecessarily, reducing unnecessary operations. | #361
- Add third board as status based board inside initial boards.

## Task Board v1.8.1

![Obsidian_EZvrK1wrX4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/56ded932-3df6-4391-b6ad-6ca09438d35e)


I wanted to implement these big optimizations in the next version, `1.9.0`. But the Kanban view was really struggling with even 1000 task cards. Hence, implemented some of the biggest planned optimizations in this release. One such technique is lazy loading of task cards and this has been tested with 50,000+ task cards. The performance should be same even for task-notes.

### Big Optimizations 🌟

- **Kanban Lazy loading :** Task cards will be rendered on demand when user will interact with the columns. Drastically improved the performance.
- **Map view on phone :** Few UX enhancements for map view on phone.

### Small Features 🎁

- Native Obsidian menu to easily delete any link on map view. | #455
- Store the map view last location data for each board separately | #489
- Show color indicator for the columns with active filters | #537
- A delete confirmation modal while deleting columns | #515

### Bug Fixes 🛠

- The completed column type is not correct in "Status based board". (#519) | Fixed ✅
- The advanced board filter menu icon is not rendered. | Fixed ✅
- Map loads indefinitely if there are zero tasks with ID. (#500) | Fixed ✅
- Tags are not being deleted through the capsules for task-notes. (#506) | Fixed ✅
- Typing in the "child task" input field inside the edit task modal is not showing the text. (#528) | Fixed ✅
- The column sorting configuration modal is not saving the configuration properly. (#531) | Fixed ✅
