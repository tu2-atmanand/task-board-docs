## Task Board 1.0.0

I am excited to announce the first official release of Task Board, to make it available on the Obsidian Plugin Marketplace.🥳🎉

### Release Overview

This initial release marks the transition from private development to public availability. Future updates will adhere to Semantic Versioning standards.

### Known Limitations and Considerations

While the plugin has been thoroughly tested, you might encounter the following aspects during usage (rare) :

- Desktop-only support: Mobile compatibility is currently under development.
- Theme compatibility: Some themes might not be fully compatible, you might feel the Task Board View do not blends well with the theme.
- Rare functionality issues: In exceptional cases, intended functionalities might not execute as expected.

If you encounter any of these issues, please report them using the [how to create request](https://tu2-atmanand.github.io/task-board-docs/Advanced/HowToCreateRequest.html) docs.

### Future Development and Contributions

A structured development plan is underway to integrate remaining functionalities for it to give what it is meant for. We invite interested individuals to join our development team and contribute to accelerating progress.
