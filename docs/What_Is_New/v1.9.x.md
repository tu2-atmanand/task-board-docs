## Task Board v1.9.0 🎉

> YouTube video for this release : https://youtu.be/_UYjZN1AVW8

Ill keep this description short, because there are too many features and enhancements to talk about in this version. But I think the section which will instantly grab your attention is the "**Experimental Features** section", especially the **Unique Kanban Swimlanes feature**. These were the reason why it took a little too long to release this version. Next version will be released sooner if there are no issues in the experimental features.

### New Features 🎁
- **Custom statuses** : A new setting section to configure custom statues their mapped actions and other configurations. Or import from Tasks plugin. | #123 
- **All pending tasks** : A new type of column, `All pending tasks`, to handle all the filtering part inside the Advanced column filtering. Now the things are possible with advanced column filters which were not possible earlier with other column types. | #614 
- **Duplicate boards** to create new boards with ease. | #560
- A new setting to change the task card style : **Emoji style** and **Bases card style**. | #458
- A new way of selectively showing/hiding specific property inside the task card, inspired from bases design. 
- **Work limit** : Set work limit to few column types and get alerts on exceeding the limit. | #395 
- Two new settings to automatically populate **completion date** and **cancelled date** when task status changes. | #632 
- Drag and re-arrange child tasks inside Add or Edit task modal to change the work order. | #465 
- **Log manager** : Task Board will now store logs like errors and warnings in a log file for future debugging. And a button in setting to export the logs.
- **Auto scan the externally modified files** : Any files modified externally (sync or editor) will be automatically picked up.
- **True Real-time mode :** A new setting to select the scanning mode type. "Real-time" mode will scan changes instantly. | #619 
- Follows the latest mobile UI design changes in Obsidian v1.11.0.


### Bug Fixes 🛠

- Few of the properties in Dataview format are not working properly. | Fixed ✅
- Entering path to non-existing note and then clicking "Open note" button in Edit task modal produces error. (#567) | Fixed ✅
- Simply opening and closing the "Add or Edit task modal" shows an error in the developers console. (#555) | Fixed ✅
- Bug report is shown too many time, if there are multiple tasks with similar IDs. (#524) | Fixed ✅
- When two boards have same name, their configurations gets overwritten. (#595) | Fixed ✅

### Deprecated 🚮

- Following 4 settings has been removed :
	- **Show header of the task card** (`showHeader`) 
	- **Show footer of the task card** (`showFooter`)
	- **Show note name in task header** (`showFileNameInCard`)
	- **Customize card sections** (`cardSectionsVisibility`)
	Instead of these multiple settings, now you have a single way to show/hide all the properties on the task card, including the checkbox.

- The setting "**Auto scan the vault on Obsidian startup**" (`scanVaultAtStartup`) has been removed. Instead a new setting has been added to auto scan all the files when Obsidian was inactive. Read the following : #641

- The setting "**Real-time scanning**" (`realTimeScanning`) has been removed. This setting has been replaced by a new setting, **Scanning mode**. Read this : #619

- As the column component will now going to have the lazy loading functionality by default, hence the "Enable lazy loading for Kanban view" (`kanbanView`) setting has been removed.

- This plugin will no longer going to store the simple `reminder` property added to notes (Obsi mobile app feature). Since, users can now easily create/convert any simple note into a task-note and add reminder to it, hence there is no need to manually add reminder property in the frontmatter. Hence, the `Notes` object is no longer supported inside the tasks cache.

### Other Changes 🔎

- **Major settings UI refactoring** with new tabs for properties, inline-tasks, and custom status management
- Implemented **queue-based file operations**: added queue management system for bulk file operations (rename, delete, create) with progress notices to improve performance. | #501
- Lazy loading functionality in the task importer panel for map view to load the panel faster.
- Updated `sanitizeTags` function to take `newTagsList` instead of single `newTag`.

- Settings has been further organized by adding two new tabs : **Properties** and **Inline tasks**. And "TB note" has been renamed to **Task notes**.
- Enhanced task status handling: refactored `checkboxStateSwitcher` to return status type information alongside symbol, enabling proper status-based date and title updates
- Improved code organization: refactored nested conditionals into switch statements, added comprehensive section comments, and reorganized enums for better maintainability
- Because of the new **Custom statuses** settings, the older setting, `tasksPluginCustomStatuses` has been removed and it will be combined into `customStatuses`.
- Fixed task ID logic: corrected `applyIdToTaskItem` to properly check for existing legacy IDs before generating new ones
- The setting **Tasks cache file path**, has been changed from drop-down to text input field with button.
